    "#### Explanation: Maximum Possible Answer and Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are framing the addition problem \"a+b=\" as a **classification task**. This means the model's goal is not to generate the sequence of digits for the answer, but to predict which *single class* the answer belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like image classification where a model predicts if an image is a \"cat,\" \"dog,\" or \"bird.\" Here, our \"classes\" are all the possible numerical answers the addition problems can produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Defining the Classes:**\n",
    "    Since our input numbers `a` and `b` are limited by `ndigit` (e.g., for `ndigit=2`, numbers range from 0 to 99), there's a maximum possible sum.\n",
    "    - If `ndigit=2`, the largest sum is 99 + 99 = 198.\n",
    "    - The smallest sum is 0 + 0 = 0.\n",
    "    So, all possible answers lie in the range \\[0, 198].\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`num_answer_classes`:**\n",
    "    Each unique integer answer in this range becomes a distinct \"class\" for our model.\n",
    "    - `max_answer = (10**ndigit - 1) + (10**ndigit - 1)` calculates this maximum sum.\n",
    "    - `num_answer_classes = max_answer + 1` determines the total number of unique classes (from 0 up to `max_answer`, inclusive). For `ndigit=2`, this is 198 + 1 = 199 classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Why Classification?**\n",
    "    By treating this as a classification problem:\n",
    "    - The model's output layer (the \"classification head\") will have `num_answer_classes` neurons.\n",
    "    - Each neuron corresponds to one possible sum (e.g., neuron 0 for answer \"0\", neuron 1 for answer \"1\", ..., neuron 198 for answer \"198\").\n",
    "    - The model will output a probability distribution over these classes, and the class with the highest probability is chosen as the predicted answer.\n",
    "    - We use `CrossEntropyLoss`, which is standard for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach simplifies the problem compared to generating an answer character by character, especially since the output (the sum) is a single entity. The model just needs to learn to map the input question sequence to the correct answer \"bucket\" or class."

    "#### Explanation: Padding Input Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer models, like the GPT-2 architecture we're using as a base, are designed to process sequences of a fixed length. However, our input questions (e.g., \"1+2=\", \"10+5=\", \"99+99=\") can have varying lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Padding?**\n",
    "1.  **Batch Processing:** To train neural networks efficiently, we feed data in batches. All sequences within a single batch must have the same length so they can be processed in parallel by the GPU or CPU.\n",
    "2.  **Fixed-Size Model Input:** The transformer architecture itself expects inputs of a predefined maximum sequence length (`n_positions` in `GPT2Config`, which we set to `max_question_length`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just like in Sklearn, when we want to use rows with missing value, we need to first fill these missing values to make every row has the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Padding Works:**\n",
    "1.  **Determine `max_question_length`:** We first calculate the maximum possible length an input question can have. For `ndigit=2`, the longest question is \"99+99=\" (6 characters). This becomes our `max_question_length`.\n",
    "2.  **Add a Padding Token:** We add a special padding character to our input vocabulary (in this case, a space ' ').\n",
    "3.  **Pad Shorter Sequences:** Any question shorter than `max_question_length` is padded with this special character (usually at the end) until it reaches the `max_question_length`.\n",
    "    - \"2+3=\" (length 4) with `max_question_length=6` becomes \"2+3=  \" (length 6).\n",
    "    - The `ljust(max_question_len)` method handles this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Optional) Attention Mechanism and Padding:**\n",
    "While the input sequences are padded, the transformer's attention mechanism can be designed (often through an attention mask) to ignore these padding tokens during computation. This ensures that the padding doesn't negatively influence the learning process. For this specific `GPT2Model` from Hugging Face, it typically handles attention masking internally based on standard padding token IDs or by allowing explicit attention masks. In our simplified setup, the model will still \"see\" the padding tokens, but their embeddings will be learned like any other token. The key is that the *structure* of the input is now uniform across the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "This padding ensures that all input tensors passed to the model have a consistent shape, which is essential for the underlying computations and batching."

    "-   **Output (One):** A single class label representing the numerical answer (e.g., class 68).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why `GPT2Model` + Custom Head?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Leveraging Transformer Power:** We still want to use the powerful sequence processing capabilities of the transformer architecture (self-attention, positional encodings, etc.) to understand the input question \"23+45=\". `GPT2Model` provides the core transformer blocks (embedding layer, multiple transformer layers) without the final language modeling layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Tailoring to Classification:**\n",
    "    -   The output of `GPT2Model` is a sequence of hidden states, one for each input token. For our classification task, we are particularly interested in the information aggregated by the transformer over the entire sequence. A common strategy is to use the hidden state of the *last* token (or a special `[CLS]` token if one were used, or an aggregation like pooling). In our case, we use the hidden state corresponding to the final input token (which is often the '=' sign or a padding token if the actual question is shorter).\n",
    "    -   This chosen hidden state (a vector of size `n_embd`) is then fed into our custom **classification head**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **The `self.classifier`:**\n",
    "    Our classification head is a simple `nn.Linear` layer: `self.classifier = nn.Linear(n_embd, num_classes)`.\n",
    "    -   It takes the `n_embd`-dimensional feature vector from the transformer.\n",
    "    -   It projects this vector into a `num_classes`-dimensional space. Each dimension in this output corresponds to one of the possible numerical answers (from 0 to `max_answer`).\n",
    "    -   The output of this linear layer are the **logits** for our classification task. Applying a softmax function to these logits gives the probabilities for each possible answer class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we use `GPT2Model` as a powerful feature extractor for our input sequence and then add a simple linear layer (`self.classifier`) on top to perform the final classification into one of the `num_answer_classes`. This adapts the general-purpose transformer architecture to our specific arithmetic task."

    "### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore whether the model struggles more with larger numbers, we grouped all addition problems by the maximum operand value in each pair (e.g., `max(12, 89) = 89`) and plotted accuracy per bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the figure above, there is a performance gap for problems involving smaller operands. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For problems where both operands are below 20, the accuracy is approximately 68%, indicating the model struggles with these “simpler” inputs.\n",
    "- Accuracy improves dramatically for mid-range values (20–40 and 40–60), reaching 90–95%, and stabilizes for larger numbers.\n",
    "- The highest performance is seen in the 60–100 range, with accuracy nearing 95% or higher, suggesting the model has learned to generalize better over time to these regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trend is somewhat counterintuitive, as one might expect smaller sums to be easier. However, the reduced accuracy in the (0–20) range may reflect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overfitting or bias toward the more frequent training examples (e.g., middle-range sums),\n",
    "- Or less diversity in how small numbers appear in the dataset, causing underexposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this analysis reveals that number magnitude does affect accuracy, but not always linearly. Surprisingly, the model appears to handle large numbers more reliably, perhaps due to better contextual patterns learned during training."

    "### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the types of mistakes made by the model, we analyzed the absolute difference between the predicted and true answers, referred to as \"off-by-X\" errors (i.e., `|pred - true|`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The bar chart above shows a striking pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The vast majority of incorrect predictions are off by 1.\n",
    "- Very few predictions are off by 2, and errors beyond that (such as off by 8, 9, or 10) are extremely rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior suggests that the model has developed a strong numerical aptitude. When it fails, it typically predicts a very close value. This aligns with what we might expect from a neural model learning fuzzy arithmetic patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that nearly all errors are small in magnitude also supports the idea that the model's internal representation of numbers is continuous and approximate, rather than symbolic or discrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- Most mistakes are near misses, especially off-by-1 errors.\n",
    "- This implies the model is generally confident in its understanding of number size but may lack fine-grained precision in boundary cases."

    "\n",
    "In human arithmetic, addition problems that involve carrying digits (e.g., `9 + 8 = 17`) are typically considered more complex than those that don't require carry (e.g., `3 + 4 = 7`). To explore whether the model also struggles more with these types of problems, we categorized each addition problem into one of two groups:\n",
    "- With Carry: at least one digit addition requires a carry.\n",
    "- No Carry: addition can be done without carrying.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bar chart above shows the model’s accuracy for each group:\n",

    "- Surprisingly, the model actually performed slightly better on problems with carry compared to those without carry.\n",
    "- Accuracy for carry problems is approximately 93%, while for non-carry problems it is slightly lower, around 91%.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that the model does not find carry-over problems more difficult, which contradicts our initial hypothesis. A potential explanation is that:\n",
    "- Carry-over problems might follow more consistent and repetitive digit patterns (like `9+1`, `8+2`, etc.), making them easier for the model to memorize.\n",
    "- Non-carry problems may involve a wider spread of values with less structured patterns, slightly reducing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this analysis reveals that carry operations do not negatively impact model performance in this task — and may even help by reinforcing strong local patterns in the training data.\n"

    "### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the model's behavior when it makes mistakes, we analyzed the confidence level of incorrect predictions. Specifically, we examined the softmax probability assigned to the top-1 prediction — even when it was wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram above shows the distribution of top-1 probabilities for all incorrect predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most incorrect predictions have a moderate confidence, centered around 0.5, indicating uncertainty.\n",
    "- Very few incorrect predictions were made with extremely low or extremely high probability — the model rarely guessed randomly or overconfidently.\n",
    "- This bell-shaped pattern suggests the model is generally aware of its own uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we computed how often the correct answer was the model’s second choice. Remarkably, in 91.8% of all wrong predictions, the true answer was the second most likely class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This insight implies:\n",
    "- The model often almost gets it right, reinforcing the idea that its internal number representations are meaningful but sometimes slightly misaligned.\n",
    "- This opens the door for future improvements through confidence-based correction or beam search over logits, especially in high-stakes applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- The model’s incorrect predictions are rarely overconfident or random.\n",
    "- The correct answer is very often close behind in the ranking, highlighting the model’s partial understanding of arithmetic structure."

    "\n",
    "To explore how different architectural and training choices affect model performance, we conducted a series of five controlled experiments. Each experiment modified one hyperparameter while keeping all others fixed. We used 5,000 training iterations and evaluated the model every 250 steps, with each evaluation averaging over 500 batches.\n",

    "\n",
    "- All configurations achieved comparable validation accuracy (≈92.8–93.0%), indicating that the model reliably learns the task under various settings.\n",
    "- The highest train accuracy was achieved with `dropout = 0.0` (Config E), suggesting that removing regularization enables the model to fit the training data more closely.\n",
    "- Increasing the embedding dimension or layer depth (Configs C and D) yielded minor improvements in training loss but no significant boost in validation performance.\n",
    "- Raising the learning rate to `1e-3` (Config B) maintained stable performance, confirming that `5e-4` is already a strong default.\n",
    "- The baseline model performs well and is sufficient for this arithmetic classification task.\n",

    "- `dropout = 0.0`\n",
    "- `learning_rate = 5e-4` (default)\n",

    "**Config E (`dropout = 0.0`)** consistently provided the best combination of training fit and generalization, making it the best choice within the 5,000-iteration training budget.\n"
